- [x] fix rubygems-update issue
- [x] Migrate fish plugin manager to fisher

- [x] Fix bash_prompt
- [x] Migrate zlogin to bash aliases
- [x] Port start-ssh-agent.fish to bash and zsh
- [x] Vim and Emacs updates shouldn't make repo dirty -- don't store packages themselves in repo
- [x] Catch-22 for running `fisher` for first time: It both requires and installs `bass`
- [x] Fix tmux line length bug in `fish_prompt` -- probably not stripping all control characters out when measuring the line length (`bash_prompt` does not have this problem)
- [x] prompt - direnv
- [x] bash prompt sometimes exibits weird behavior -- moving the start of the prompt to the middle of the line or even the previous line. Guessing there are special characters not being printed properly, or maybe the normal escape sequence isn't clearing everything
- [x] Make tmux status bar more like vim's (https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim)
- [x] Finish emacs tmuxline-ification
- [x] Make `PS1` fallback look like `bash_prompt`
- [ ] Only update packages lists if `--save` flag is set so that repo stays clean after `update`

- [x] Better manage vim and nvim configs
- [x] BUG: Is `./install -f` removing dirs during `link_children`?
- [x] Remove noise from atom status bar
- [x] Get rid of `basic.vim`? No, it has some nice settings.
- [x] wth_color escape sequences sometimes dont' work over ssh/tmux
- [ ] Make prompt faster
  - [x] Figure out why https://github.com/edkolev/promptline.vim is so much faster, and incorporate changes
  - [ ] Port above changes to fish
  - [ ] Have upsearch only run once, searching for all relevant items. This is way more work but should also be way faster
- [ ] BUG: update-python on arch overwrites packages that are managed by pacman, causing pacman updates to fail
- [x] BUG: On interactive login: `set: Tried to change the read-only variable '_'` Has something to do with adding "/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin" to PATH
