- [x] fix rubygems-update issue
- [x] Migrate fish plugin manager to fisher
- [x] aliases: move to ~ and make compatible with fish, bash, zsh so they all use the same aliases file
- [x] do the same for private.fish
- [x] fix arch sed error
- [x] install.sh: colorize output
- [x] Fix bash_prompt
- [x] Migrate zlogin to bash aliases
- [x] Port start-ssh-agent.fish to bash and zsh
- [x] Vim and Emacs updates shouldn't make repo dirty -- don't store packages themselves in repo
- [x] Catch-22 for running `fisher` for first time: It both requires and installs `bass`
- [x] Fix tmux line length bug in `fish_prompt` -- probably not stripping all control characters out when measuring the line length (`bash_prompt` does not have this problem)
- [x] prompt - direnv
- [x] bash prompt sometimes exibits weird behavior -- moving the start of the prompt to the middle of the line or even the previous line. Guessing there are special characters not being printed properly, or maybe the normal escape sequence isn't clearing everything
- [x] Make tmux status bar more like vim's (https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim)
- [x] Finish emacs tmuxline-ification
- [ ] Only update packages lists if `--save` flag is set so that repo stays clean after `update`
  - [ ] `update-fish`: problematic because fisher updates ~/.config/fish/functions/*
  - [x] All the rest
- [x] Better manage vim and nvim configs
- [x] Is `./install -f` removing dirs during `link_children`?
- [x] Remove noise from atom status bar
- [x] Get rid of `basic.vim`? No, it has some nice settings.
- [ ] install / install.settings should use arrays, not lists, for variables
- [ ] Individual app screenshots
- [ ] demo gif
- [ ] write blog post tour
