* TODO Eshell =rm= hangs when pressing =RET=
Actually, it is working, it just takes a long time and gives zero feedback. Can we fix this?
** Takes too long
** Gives zero feedback (doesn't even go to new line when pressing =RET= until it is completely done)
** Outputs =t= for each file deleted. It should give the same feedback as =*rm=.

** TODO Editing
** TODO Eshell
* TODO =copy-region-other-window= and =move-region-other-window= should also copy the line if no region is selected

Right now it jumps around in a way I don't understand. Maybe something to do with ring mechanics?
* TODO Desktop should restore eshell buffers
=desktop-plus.el= could be used for this. It currently has support for shell, but not eshell.
* TODO Make Eshell prompt look good with a light theme
* TODO term-mode filter out escape sequence
This happens when running =fish= in =shell-mode=:

Guessing this is the (remains of the?) xterm sequence to set the title?

- State "DONE"       from "WIP"        [2018-11-18 Sun 18:05]
This seems to be fixed for most buffers but Org buffers are still terrible

** TODO Parinfer is slow
* TODO Fix Eshell/shell/term bouncing shell output up and down [1/3]
Not sure if these are all the same issue. Fix term first, see if it affects the others.
** DONE term - it isn't the same issue. It was the mouse scroll settings that appear to be completely unnecessary anyway. Removed them and it helped term-mode updates a lot. Did not affect shell/eshell bouncing.
