* TODO Eshell =rm= hangs when pressing =RET=
Actually, it is working, it just takes a long time and gives zero feedback. Can we fix this?
** Takes too long
** Gives zero feedback (doesn't even go to new line when pressing =RET= until it is completely done)
** Outputs =t= for each file deleted. It should give the same feedback as =*mv=.
* TODO Find and squash causes of unresponsiveness in remote contexts [0/2]
** TODO Editing
** TODO Eshell
* TODO =copy-region-other-window= and =move-region-other-window= should also copy the line if no region is selected
* TODO Get =pointhistory= to work
Right now it jumps around in a way I don't understand. Maybe something to do with ring mechanics?
* TODO Desktop should restore eshell buffers
=desktop-plus.el= could be used for this. It currently has support for shell, but not eshell.
* TODO Make Eshell prompt look good with a light theme
* TODO term-mode filter out escape sequence
This happens when running =fish= in =shell-mode=:
=]0;fish=
Guessing this is the (remains of the?) xterm sequence to set the title?
* TODO Figure out magit wip modes
* TODO Mojave issues [1/4]
** DONE Re-compile with new changes
- State "DONE"       from "WIP"        [2018-10-02 Tue 21:33]
** TODO Inserting characters is slow (try holding down a key--it doesn't keep up with repeat rate)
This seems to be fixed for most buffers but Org buffers are still terrible
** TODO Scrolling is slow
** TODO Parinfer is slow
* TODO Fix Eshell/shell/term bouncing shell output up and down [1/3]
Not sure if these are all the same issue. Fix term first, see if it affects the others.
** DONE term - it isn't the same issue. It was the mouse scroll settings that appear to be completely unnecessary anyway. Removed them and it helped term-mode updates a lot. Did not affect shell/eshell bouncing.
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-08-31 Fri 11:03]
** TODO shell
** TODO eshell
* TODO Get Eshell/tramp to cache and/or save passwords [2/4]
Enable logging with =(setq auth-source-debug t)=
** DONE For the user
** DONE For sudo/sudoers - alias for su/sudo?
** TODO What about when sudo is called in other ways, such as from a script? It doesn't seem to cache the password then.
** TODO How to ignore password prompting for just for a specific command?
See:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions

This is already added. do we have to do something else?
* TODO Implement =grc= in elisp
