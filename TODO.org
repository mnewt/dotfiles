* Dotfiles TODO List
** DONE fix rubygems-update issue
** DONE Migrate fish plugin manager to fisher
** DONE aliases: move to ~ and make compatible with fish, bash, zsh so
   they all use the same aliases file
** DONE do the same for private.fish
** DONE fix arch sed error
** DONE install.sh: colorize output
** DONE Fix bash_prompt
** DONE Migrate zlogin to bash aliases
** DONE Port start-ssh-agent.fish to bash and zsh
** DONE Vim and Emacs updates shouldn't make repo dirty -- don't store packages themselves in repo
** DONE Catch-22 for running =fisher= for first time: It both requires and installs =bass=
** DONE Fix tmux line length bug in =fish_prompt= -- probably not stripping all control characters out when measuring the line length
   (=bash_prompt= does not have this problem)
** DONE prompt - direnv
** DONE bash prompt sometimes exibits weird behavior
   Moving the start of the prompt to the middle of the line or even the previous line. Guessing there are special characters not being printed properly, or maybe the normal escape sequence isn't clearing everything
** DONE Make tmux status bar more like vim's
   (https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim)
** DONE Finish emacs tmuxline-ification
** DONE Make =PS1= fallback look like =bash_prompt=
** DONE Only update packages lists if =--save= flag is set so that repo stays clean after =update= [3/3]
   - [X] Move all fish config to plugin
   - [X] =update-fish=: problematic because fisher updates
     ~/.config/fish/functions/*
   - [X] All the rest
** DONE Better manage vim and nvim configs
** DONE BUG: Is =./install -f= removing dirs during =link_children=?
** DONE Remove noise from atom status bar
** DONE Get rid of =basic.vim=? No, it has some nice settings.
** DONE with_color escape sequences sometimes dont' work over ssh/tmux. should also be way faster
** DONE BUG: update-python on arch overwrites packages that are managed by pacman, causing pacman updates to fail
** DONE BUG: On interactive login:
   =set: Tried to change the read-only variable '_'= Has something to dowith adding "/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin" to PATH
** DONE BUG: Error message is displayed from prompt when tmux is not in path
** DONE Move prompt to its own plugin/repo - teleprompt
** DONE BUG: =install=: Don't create files with literal name of '*' in created directories (=link-children=) - only happens when specifying source path on command line?
** DONE BUG: Why does it always link .parinfer-file-extentions.txt?
** DONE BUG: =inf-clojure= sets =comint-send-input= on every shell
** DONE BUG: dired+ often doesn't work or doesn't work completely (details not hidden and/or highlighting not working)
** DONE Emacs: macos proced doesn't show all columns
** DONE Get =diff-hl= to work
** DONE Get =gist= to work
** DONE tramp: add hostname to mode-line when connected via tramp
** DONE Re-enable company-mode in tramp and optimize
** DONE Move any requires in =init.el= to use-package
** DONE Add =eless= to aliases
** DONE Move =path.fish= to =env=
** DONE install / install.settings should use arrays, not lists, for variables
** DONE BUG: =ignore= in =install.settings= is getting ignored
** DONE Move to bare git repo
   (https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)
** DONE Talk about eshell in README
** DONE Move README to org format
** DONE Finish source
** DONE Make bare repo setup compatible with magit and projectile. Could use a `link' and `unlink' function to create a temporary $HOME/.git file. See example: https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/460#issuecomment-36139308 and https://gitorious.org/magit/skangas-detached-worktree#more
** DONE Make yanking indentation work on a newline inside a form in parinfer (mac-key-mode's =clipboard-yank-and-indent= needs to work with parinfer's =parinfer-smart-yank:yank=. 
   Maybe advise the latter? Could turn on parinfer-paren-mode while yanking)
** DONE Update readme with new non-bare repo setup
** DONE Fix Windows problems
** DONE eshell should have a way to cd relative to tramp path
   Example:
   pwd: =/sshx:host:/some/path=
   =cd :/other/path= => =/sshx:host:/other/path=

** DONE Fix yank-pop deleting a bunch more than the previous yank       :bug:
   What are repro steps? Does this happen only when there are characters on
   the line after point? 

   Thinking we should use a temp buffer to build the yanked text using parinfer
   as normal, then insert it at point. 

   All that sounded great, but when I removed the kludgey advice I had created,
   everything seemed to work. Not sure what changed but super.

** DONE Make solarized theme colors work with eshell

** DONE Fix org-mode <s expansion                                       :bug:
   Had to do with running HEAD version of org-mode. Stopped that.
** DONE Improve and unify persistence
** DONE Add script to set up new computer
** DONE Eshell copy and kill output
** DONE =find= in eshell runs elisp function find. It should run the system =find= utility.
** DONE use org/outline to fold top level sections
** DONE Fix search in Notes
** DONE Eshell read-only prompt
** DONE Eshell import aliases from bash
** DONE M-x shell bash completion
*** https://github.com/szermatt/emacs-bash-completion
** DONE outline-minor-mode should not trample on key binding "M-<up>"
** DONE Advise =eshell/cd= such that paths starting with "/" and "~" are interpreted relative to the remote host
** TODO Get Eshell/tramp to cache and/or save passwords [0/2]
*** TODO For the user
*** TODO For sudo/sudoers
** TODO Add git-ls-files command
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24993868/how-do-you-list-tracked-files-git-ls-files-in-magit#25227438
** TODO "s-n" should create a new scratch buffer
** TODO Fix Eshell / tramp tab completion adding a space after the file name
** TODO Implement =grc= in elisp
** TODO Find and squash causes of unresponsiveness when editing remote files
** TODO term-mode filter out escape sequence
   This happens when running =fish= in =shell-mode=:
   =]0;fish=
   Guessing this is the (remains of the?) xterm sequence to set the title?
** TODO =copy-region-other-window= and =move-region-other-window= should also copy the line if no region is selected
** TODO Get =pointhistory= to work
   Right now it jumps around in a way I don't understand. Maybe something to do with ring mechanics?
** TODO Add indicator to modeline when narrowing
** TODO Implement quick dotfiles backup script (for when I want it backed up but don't want to bother with a git commit)
** TODO Desktop should restore eshell buffers
   =desktop-plus.el= could be used for this. It currently has support for shell, but not eshell.
** TODO w3m easily view buffer in appropriate mode
   Such as displaying a markdown file in `markdown-mode`. Maybe just copy the buffer to another buffer and change mode based on the original buffer's file name?
** TODO Make Eshell prompt look good with a light theme
