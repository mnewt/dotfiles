# Settings for the `install` script
# This file tells install what to ignore, link, copy, and create
# List files (and globs) separated by spaces

# The below options are in order of precedence (1 is highest), so `ignore`
# overrides `link_children`, which overrides `copy`, which overrides `link`
# That is why it's acceptable to specify '*' for link, because the other patterns
# will remove the files from link that they match.

# Run before the `install` operations
before () {
  :
}

# 1. Ignore these files (modifies include)
ignore='install* images scripts Icon* *.md'

# 2. Create directory itself (not contents), then link the children of the directory
# NOTE: It will not delete an existing directory. If you want to do that, run:
#       `rm -rf ~/.directory && ./install`
link_children='config atom'

# 3. Copy these files
copy=''

# 4. Link these files
link='*'

# Run after the `install` operations
after () {
  :
}
