# Settings for the `install` script
# This file tells install.sh what to ignore, link, copy, and create
# List files (and globs) separated by spaces
# The below options are in order of priority, so ignore overrides
# link_children, which overrides copy, which overrides link
# That is why it's OK to just specify '*' for link

# ignore these files (modifies include)
ignore='install* images scripts Icon* *.md *.sh TODO*'

# create directory itself (not contents), then link the children of the directory
# NOTE: it will not delete the directory. If you want to replace the directory,
#				delete it first, then run `install`
link_children='config atom'

# just copy these files
copy=''

# list of files to link
link='*'
